A couple of days ago, I came across some YouTube videos about MCP and how to use it inside VSCode. I was kinda fascinated by the idea of how much my development workflow would improve if I could start using AI tools in my day-to-day work (Spoiler: It can't improve because my current patrons don't allow it, but a man can dream, right?).
So I decided to give Vibe Coding a try (more on that in a later post), and I ended up with a new blog page inside my website. I had some old posts that I wanted to recover, so I started looking for them.

I used to write a lot in my old blog. I've had several iterations of it, but never got to the point of consistently posting. I had a few that I want to recover, so I started looking for them. Then I realised that most of the platforms I used to write in were gone, or the posts were lost in the ether of the internet. I decided to take matters into my own hands and recover what I could. _Into the ether I went_.

The ether of the internet is, of course, Facebook, and I remember myself to be quite active there, surely a younger version of myself had to share them there. After a few hours of scrolling through memes, old pics, cringe-worthy posts; I found a few of them... Unfortunately, I wouldn't share those posts anymore. Actually, I'd recommend that you stay away from my Facebook profile; it's a dark place full of bad decisions and questionable life choices. To be honest, it was not that bad. I had a good time going through my old profile.

So, after all that, I'm back to the only posts I have on Medium, and I decided to migrate them to my new blog. Hopefully, they will find a new home here. These posts are almost a decade old, so a lot has happened since then. I like to think that I've grown since then, but I still find some of the topics interesting. I hope you do too.
