# Scheduled Post Example

This post demonstrates the scheduling functionality. It has a `publish` field set to a future date, so it won't be visible until that date arrives.

## How It Works

1. **Draft Posts**: Posts without a `publish` field are considered drafts and won't be shown
2. **Scheduled Posts**: Posts with a `publish` date in the future won't be shown until that date
3. **Published Posts**: Posts with a `publish` date in the past or today will be visible

This allows you to:

- Write drafts without publishing them
- Schedule content to go live at specific times
- Control your content publication workflow

Pretty neat, right?
